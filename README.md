# AVLTree Project

This project implements an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. The AVL tree ensures that the tree remains balanced after every insertion by performing rotations.

## How to Run the Project

**Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIKIHERSHCOVITZ/AVLTreeProject-2021.git
cd AVLTreeProject-2021
```

**Open in IntelliJ IDEA**:

Open IntelliJ IDEA.

Click on Open and select the AVLTreeProject directory.

**Run the Project:**:

Open AVLTree.java in IntelliJ IDEA.

Click on the green run arrow next to the main method or right-click and select Run 'Main.main()'.

## Functionality of the Project
The AVLTree class provides the following functionality:
1. Insertion: Inserts a key into the AVL tree and balances the tree if necessary.
2. Pre-order Traversal: Prints the pre-order traversal of the tree.

## What the Script Can Do
1. Insert Elements: You can insert elements into the AVL tree.
2. Balance the Tree: The tree automatically balances itself after each insertion.
3. Pre-order Traversal: You can print the tree in pre-order to see its structure.


## Example
For an example please run the main class.
The output shows a visualization of the tree

Preorder traversal of constructed tree is :

30 20 10 25 70 50 40 60 80 90

The expected output is:

30 20 25 70 60 40 80 90
